# Welcome to the React Calculator with TS!

The main reason for this project is to try to complete it with little to no Google / AI assistance. This can be quite the challenge, so let's see how it goes! Try it yourself! There is no rush!

## License
This project is licensed under the MIT license.

## Description
This will be a single page React Calculator with TypeScript and vanilla CSS (Call me crazy, but I absolutely love Vanilla CSS. Tailwind Is awesome, bu there is something about the original...)

## Motivation
I want to propose a challenge for you all: Try to do as much as you can without Google / AI assistance! As we all know ChatGTP can create this project incredibly quickly, but this doesn't make you a better coder! Obviously we will need to result to Google / AI, but do as much as you can without it!

## Usage
In the root folder of this application, you can run: ```npm start```

## Strange Bugs
If your JSX doesn't work correctly, try running ```npm install @types/react@latest @types/react-dom@latest```. This should clear up any JSX errors such as ```h1' does not exist on type 'JSX.IntrinsicElements```

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute as much as you like. I only ask that you make a PR once you are done with your coding session so others can work on it as well!
